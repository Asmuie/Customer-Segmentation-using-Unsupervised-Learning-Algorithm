# Customer-Segmentation-using-Unsupervised-Learning-Algorithm

**[Mall Customer Segmentation Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/shwetabh123/mall-customers)** : Let's imagine you're owning a supermarket mall and through membership cards, you have some basic data about your customers like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score, which is something you assign to the customer based on your defined parameters like customer behavior and purchasing data.

The main aim of this problem is learning the purpose of the customer segmentation concepts, also known as market basket analysis, trying to understand customers and sepparate them in different groups according to their preferences, and once the division is done, this information can be given to marketing team so they can plan the strategy accordingly.

**Data Set Information**  

This dataset is composed by the following five features:

* CustomerID: Unique ID assigned to the customer
* Gender: Gender of the customer
* Age: Age of the customer
* Annual Income (k$): Annual Income of the customer
* Spending Score (1-100): Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature.


In this particular dataset we have 200 samples to study.

To visualize our data and plot important information so we can see the different values our data has and its behaviour. To do so, we are only going to consider the following features: Annual_income and Spending_score. 

In this project we will focus on 2 types of clustering method which is K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering method. Both will be using the same data set an we will compare the result.
